    In this stage, the movie is edited and polished. Undesirable scenes are cut or shortened to service the overall narrative.<br>
    The final sound mix is created and the voice recordings are synchronized with the entire movies.<br>
    Special effects are added, including the opening titles and the closing credits. Once this is done, the movie is now considered locked.<br>
    The final cut is now ready for printing, duplication and distribution.<br>
