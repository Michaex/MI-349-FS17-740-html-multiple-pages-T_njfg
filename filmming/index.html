    <h1>Filmming</h1>

      The actual shooting of the movie happens in this stage. Shooting involves setting up props,
      lighting being rigged and actors being put in their respective costumes.<br>
      All the clips shot in a day are processed roughly and it is then viewed by the director and select members of the crew. <br>
      This is done regularly so the crew and the cast are kept motivated and aware of how the movie is progressing. <br>
      The director declares â€œIt's a wrap!" when the shooting is over and all scenes are done. <br>
      The movie is now in the can and the cast and crew celebrate this usually with a wrap party.  <br>
