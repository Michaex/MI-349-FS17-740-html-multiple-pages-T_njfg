    <h1>The filmmaking process step by step</h1>
    <ul>
      When you make a film, you need to follow an organised filmmaking process. Itâ€™s best to think of it as three distinct stages:
      <li>planning and getting ready to film (pre-production) </li>
          <a href="planning">planning</a>

      <li>filming (production) </li>
          <a href="filmming">filmming</a>

      <li>completing the film and getting it ready to show (post-production).</li>
          <a href="completing">completing</a>

    </ul>
